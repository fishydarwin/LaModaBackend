# LaModă [BACKEND]

A fictional website (in Romanian) which lets users post articles of their latest in-fashion 
clothing, make-up, manicure and so on... Front-end is Angular, and back-end is Java Spring.

I am currently still working on the back-end and its README.
You should look over on the front-end GitHub page for more info.
